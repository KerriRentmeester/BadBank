# **Project Name**:  

Bad Bank

# **Description**: 

The Bad Bank project, a React app, is "bad" because there is no security. As a banking app, however; it has a register and login page, as well as a deposit and withdraw page. Additionally, there is a home page, balance page, and a page with all the data.

The Bad Bank project is an example of the following skills and capabilities: routing, context, tracking state, event handling, parent/child relationships, and forms. I employed Bootstrap for styling, HTML5, JavaScript, JSX, and CSS. As such, this project is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of a similar activity I worked on in September of 2023 from the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

I changed the original course task in the following ways:
*varied the card color for register, login, deposit, and withdraw pages to further differentiate among the banking tasks.

# **Installation & Dependencies**: 

The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Bootstrap, Babel.

To use the app, follow these steps:
*Clone the repository or download the code files.
*Navigate to the project directory in your editor (ex/VSCode).
*Click on LiveServer.

# **Usage / How to Run**:

The app initiates on the home page, which is fairly generic, giving instructions to use the nav bar to perform desired tasks. The first step would be to "Create Account" or "Login." Once logged in, the user can "Deposit" or "Withdraw", see the account "Balance", or see "AllData."
